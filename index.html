									<h2>About</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									I am a recent graduate from Imperial College London School of Medicine, with an intercalated BSc in Cardiovascular Sciences (First Class Honours) currently working as an Academic Foundation Year 1 Doctor in Cardiff. </p><p>

									I am passionate about medical innovation with growing experience in several programming languages (predominantly working with Matlab and Python). I am also avaliable as a freelance web developer and have extensive experience in media and publicity roles. </p><p>								

									I am Co-Founder of the Imperial College School of Medicine Coding Society (reaching 292 members after 6 months and shortlisted for New Society of the Year at the IC Union Awards 18) and Medic Lead for the IC HealthHackathon 2018. </p><p>

									I am currently seeking medical technology and coding-related projects in Cardiff to get involved in alongside my junior doctor jobs. </br></br>

									<h3> Automatic Identification of Global Features and Local Features of the Human Heart </h3>

									<p> <h6>NATIONAL HEART AND LUNG INSTITUTE  |  TAN, L; MIELEWCZIK, M; DHUTIA, N; FRANCIS, D </h6>

									</p> <p> I created a fully-automated, vendor independent library to identify cardinal landmarks (mitral and tricuspid valve annuli) on moving echocardiographic images using a spatio-temporal-variance approach with analysis of greyscale histograms.  I then validated both robustness and accuracy of several different imaging processing approaches in identifying these points. 
									</p><p>Automation of the imaging analysis process for echocardiography has the potential to  improve efficiency and accessibility. My program is able to identify initial landmarks in an operator-independent manner to then allow further workflows to run and enable automatic quantification of cardiac structure and function.  
									</p><p>
									Exhibited as a poster presentation at the IC Biomedical Symposium 2017 (Hammersmith        Hospital) and the Cardiovascular Undergraduate Conference 2018 (Imperial College London).

								<h3> A robust and fast algorithm for fully automated detection of the ultrasound cone in echocardiographic image sequences </h3>

									<p> <h6>NATIONAL HEART AND LUNG INSTITUTE | MIELEWCZIK, M; TAN, L; DHUTIA, N; FRANCIS, D </h6>

									</p> <p> To achieve accurate analysis of ultrasound images, an important first step is identifying the cone shaped image sector to eliminate unnecessary processing of irrelevant regions. </p><p>
									I assisted in creating a robust and reliable program using MATLAB, able to detect the active ultrasound    image sector fully automatically within seconds. I then tested four different implementations of this program and evaluated them for robustness and reliability, achieving 100% accuracy in a large set of multi-beat imaging sequences comprising image qualities from low to high.

								<h3> Association between peri-operative angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-2 receptor blockers and acute kidney injury in major elective non-cardiac surgery: a multicentre, prospective cohort study. </h3>

									<p> <h6>ANAESTHESIA 2018 JUL 9. <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/anae.14349" target="_blank"><u> DOI: 10.1111/ANAE.14349.</u></a> </br>[EPUB AHEAD OF PRINT] | STARSURG COLLABORATIVE  </h6>

									 <p> In this prospective, observational, multicentre study, I assisted in collecting data as part of the STARSurg Collaborative on behalf of St Mary’s Hospital, London. </p><p> The study aimed to identify whether withholding ACE-i/ARBs peri-operatively reduces the incidence of AKI following major surgery (GI or liver). A total of 949 patients were included from across 160 centres. In conclusion, it was found that withholding ACE-i/ARBs did not demonstrate a protective effect (p = 0.567).
